As I like mathematical modeling, most blog post will deal with mathematical modeling and optimization. But will also contain some quick introductions to technical stuff like use quarto for publishing or github actions.

Although I like detailed explainations, for example when I am getting into something new, I prefer condensed material for quick look ups to. Hence here I focus on the abstract description and most blog posts should be considered as a lookup table.

Material from the old blog in particular optimization under uncertainty will be added soon.
