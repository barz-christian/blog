    "One usage of these tool could be: Suppose we have factories with certain capacities producing certain products. We used a linear program to derive an optimal solution how to use our resources best. In this optimal setting some factories will running at their capacity limit.\n",
    "Now suppose we want to produce/sell more, hence we have to increase the capacities. Hence a natural question is which capacities should be increased first. Of course we could do simmulations using our linear program, but with the help of what we will see soon these information are allready available with our optimal solution.\n",
