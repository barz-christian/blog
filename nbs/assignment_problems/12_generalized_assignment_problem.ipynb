    "\n",
    "Given a set of agents and a set of tasks and for each pair (agent, task) a costs or profit value. Moreover each agent has a budget, whcih means that the sum of costs assigned to an agent can not exceed his budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find an assigment of agents to tasks such that the overall profit is maximized. (More precisely each task is assigned to only one agent.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Its known that the generalized assignment problem is NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If all agent budgets and tasks costs are equal to one, then the problem is the [assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem)\n",
    "1. If consts and profits of all tasks are equal for each agent, then the problem reduces to the [multiple knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n",
    "1. If there is only a single agent, then the problem reduces to the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)\n",
